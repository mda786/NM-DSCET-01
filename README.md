# NM-DSCET-01
INTRODUCTION
• Purpose:
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of
a real-time chat application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js,
Node.js) and Socket.io. This application will facilitate instant messaging between
users in a seamless and efficient manner.

• Scope
The MERN Stack Chat App will provide users with
the ability to create accounts, join chat rooms,
and engage in real-time conversations with other
users. The application will be designed to support
multiple chat rooms, private messaging, and user
authentication.

SOFTWARE OVERVIEW
• System Description:
The MERN Stack Chat App will consist of a front-end built with
React.js for the user interface, a back-end developed using
Node.js and Express.js, MongoDB as the database for storing
user data and chat messages, and Socket.io for real-time
communication.

• System Features:
• User Registration and Authentication
• Creation and Joining of Chat Rooms
• Real-time Chat Messaging
• Private Messaging between Users
• User Profile Management
• Notifications for New Messages

Functional Requirements
• Chat Room Management:
Users should be able to create new chat rooms, join existing ones, and
leave chat rooms. Each chat room should have a unique identifier.
• User Registration and Authentication:
The system shall provide user registration and authentication functionality, allowing
users to create accounts and log in securely.

Non-Functional Requirements
• Performance:
The application should be able to handle a large number of concurrent
users and messages efficiently.
• Scalability:
The system should be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate an
increasing number of users and messages.
• Security:
User authentication and data transmission should be secure. Passwords must be
encrypted, and communication between the client and server should be protected.

Constraints
• Technology Stack:
The application shall be developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB,
Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Socket.io.
• Browser Compatibility:
The application shall be compatible with modern web browsers, including
but not limited to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.
